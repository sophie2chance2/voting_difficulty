anes_data_2022 <- read.csv("anes_pilot_2022_csv_20221214.csv", header = TRUE)

#Notes on the data:

#There are three categories associated with the respondents and that impacted the types of questions, RAND_PIPE 1, 2, 3
#RAND_PIPE 1 and 3 was asked questions turnout22, turnout22ns, and turnout22w
#RAND_PIPE 2 was asked quetsions pipevote22a, pipevote22b
#All RAND_PIPE participants were asked votehard


#There are two categories assocaited with respondents and that impacted the types of questions, RAND_PID 1, 2
#RAND_PID 1 was asked pid1d
#RAND_PID 2 was asked pid1r


#The documentation says that there are 1500 that are used to represent the population but 85 that are not and consequently did not receive weights. To remove the 85 you need to remove the entries that do not have weights in the weight or weight_spss columns

#For the PID and PIPE groupings, the columns that are NOT aligned to the questions the participants received will have a '-1'

#We removed 267 entries that are not DEM or REP, to include leaning DEM and/or leaning REP

#We removed 257 entries that did not vote (138 in PIPE 1,3; 15 in PIPE 1,3 that said they probably did not vote; 104 for the PIPE 2 that stated they did not vote)

#Tasks to clean the data:

#Remove all of the entries that are not weighted and thus do not reflect the population, per the documentation
