# Lab 1 

This is the first data lab for UCB MIDS w203. 

This is a team-based Lab.  Your instructor will divide you into teams of about three students. You goal on this laboratory is to maximize your learning. The best way to accomplish this is to have all teammates engage with every lab component. 

We ask that you meet with your teammates as soon as possible to coordinate expectations around working together. To guide your discussion, we have included the team_discussion document for you to fill in as a team. This document is ungraded.

At the end of the lab, we will ask you to submit a short evaluation of your teammates. Note that a single negative review will not affect a student's grade; we may enact a deduction when multiple reviews consistently point to a general problem. 

The lab consists of two parts. **Part One** consists of short exercises similar to homework that you have worked on throughout the course. **Part Two** is a very brief (i.e. three pages) written statistical analysis. The specifics of the prompt are in [`lab_1.pdf`](./lab_1.pdf). 

This lab should be submitted to Gradescope. There is one submission slot for Part One, and another submission slot for Part Two. The submissions are set as *group submissions* which means that there should be only one submission per group, with each of the group members associated with that submission. Adding teammates is intuitive, but this [walk-through](https://help.gradescope.com/article/m5qz2xsnjy-student-add-group-members) created by Gradescope can help you if you get stuck.
